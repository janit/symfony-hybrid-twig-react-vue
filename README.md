==========

A Symfony project created on January 14, 2017, 9:23 am.

An ongoing effort to provide a working  example concept of simply
sharing a state object between the Twig template rendering engine
as well as JavaScript view layers Vue and React.

The application comes complete with an SQLite database and a built
JavaScript clients to keep overhead of installation minimal. The

understanding of OO PHP and Symfony, so it's better just to take
a look for yourself to see if this feels like a good idea or not.
